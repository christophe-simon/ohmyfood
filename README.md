<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Ohmyfood Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Ohmyfood! is an fictive online meal ordering company. Their concept allows users to compose their own menu and reduce their waiting time in restaurants as their menu is prepared in advance.

This project is their mobile app, proposing the menu of 4 great Parisian restaurants, made as a student project.

It was made from these mockups:
- [Home page](docs/homepage.png)
- [Menu page from the "A la française" restaurant](docs/menupage-a-la-francaise.png)
- [Menu page from the "La note enchantée" restaurant](docs/menupage-la-note-enchantee.png)
- [Menu page from the "La palette du goût" restaurant](docs/menupage-la-palette-du-gout.png)
- [Menu page from the "Le délice des sens" restaurant](docs/menupage-le-delice-des-sens.png)

The requirements were:
- Development should be done in CSS, without JavaScript.
- No framework should be used, however the use of SASS would be a plus.
- No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.
- All code should be versioned on GitHub and the site should be accessible on Github Pages once completed.
- As the target audience is connected and in a hurry, the site will be developed using
mobile-first approach. For this reason, only mobile mockups will be made.
- On tablet and desktop, the site will have to adapt, but given that these supports are not a priority, their layout is open to a personnal vision from the developper.

### Built With

- Markdown, Html, Css, Sass
